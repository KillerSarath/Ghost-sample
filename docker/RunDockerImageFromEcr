# After all DockerInstallationOnEC2, PullDockerImage, PushDockerImage, you can finally see your docker image being pushed to ECR and now ready to consume.
# We will delete the local image first and then try to pull it back from the ECR.


# To pull docker image from ECR

docker pull 176181560477.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/nordcloud-ghost

# To run docker image on EC2 from ECR

docker run --rm 176181560477.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/nordcloud-ghost
