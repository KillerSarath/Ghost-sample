# To install Docker on an Amazon EC2 instance
# Step 1: Launch an instance with the Amazon Linux 2 or Amazon Linux AMI.
# Step 2: Connect to your instance.
# Step 3: Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.

sudo yum update -y

# Step 4: Install the most recent Docker Engine package.

Amazon Linux 2

sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker

# Step 5: Start the Docker service.

sudo service docker start

# Step 6: On Amazon Linux 2, to ensure that the Docker daemon starts after each system reboot, run the following command:

sudo systemctl enable docker

# Step 7: Add the ec2-user to the docker group so you can execute Docker commands without using sudo.

sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

# Step 8: Log out and log back in again to pick up the new docker group permissions. You can accomplish this by closing your current SSH terminal window and reconnecting to your instance in a new one. Your new SSH session will have the appropriate docker group permissions.

# Step 9: Verify that the ec2-user can run Docker commands without sudo.

docker info
