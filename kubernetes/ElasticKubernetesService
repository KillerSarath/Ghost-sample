# Getting started with AWS EKS
# Prerequisites
# kubectl – A command line tool for working with Kubernetes clusters.
# eksctl – A command line tool for working with EKS clusters that automates many individual tasks.
# Required IAM permissions – The IAM security principal that you're using must have permissions to work with Amazon EKS IAM roles and service linked roles, AWS CloudFormation, and a VPC and related resources.

# Step 1: Create your Amazon EKS cluster and nodes

eksctl create cluster --name ghost-kubctl --region eu-west-1

# Output

  [✓]  EKS cluster "ghost-kubctl" in "eu-west-1" region is ready

# Step 2: View Kubernetes resources
    # a. View your cluster nodes.

        kubectl get nodes -o wide

    # Output


    # b. View the workloads running on your cluster.

         kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide

    # Output
